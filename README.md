This is a sample template for the website portion of the ENG 100 projects.
You'll find in index.html that jQuery and Bootstrap are already being loaded.

To upload these files to your cPanal automatically, in a terminal, type

> ./sync.sh

You'll encounter a series of prompts that will help you upload this whole entire
directory into your public_ftp folder.

Credits to Cole Gleason who wrote the original sync.sh file in this folder,
as well as the many other files. This project was originally written for
CS398 VL, and it can be accessed here:

I simply adapted his work to fit the purpose of ENG 100.
